## Project description
Purpose of this project is to build REST APIs in Laravel (PHP framework). I've created one simple REST API which fetchs photographer's details along with two table migration files. 

Most entry level developers find Laravel hard but trust me Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects
